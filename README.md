**OBJECTIVE**

Create a web or mobile application to help users manage theirtasks and projects efficiently, facilitating better organizationand productivity.

---

### **Technologies Used:**

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page, including the task input field, buttons, and task list.
 
- **CSS**: For styling the page, providing a visually appealing interface with modern design elements such as gradients, buttons, and list styling.
  
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic interactions, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting them, and saving tasks to localStorage.

### **Key Features:**

• Add new tasks to the task list.

• Mark tasks as completed and strike them through.

• Delete tasks from the list.

• Tasks persist after page refresh using localStorage.

• Simple and intuitive user interface for managing tasks.

### **Project Breakdown:**

#### **Header Section:**
- The page displays the title **"Task Manager"** prominently.
- Contains an input field for entering new tasks and a button to add them to the task list.

#### **Main Section (Task List):**
- Displays tasks dynamically based on user input.
- Each task appears as a list item with:
  - The task name.
  - A button to mark the task as completed or not.
  - A button to delete the task.
  
- Tasks can be toggled between completed (strikethrough effect) or active.

#### **Functionality:**

- **Add Task**: When a user types a task and clicks the "Add Task" button, the task is added to the list and saved to localStorage.
  
- **Complete Task**: Clicking the "completed" button marks the task as completed (adds a line-through effect).
  
- **Delete Task**: The delete button removes the task from the list.

- **Local Storage**: The tasks persist even after refreshing the page because they are saved in localStorage.

#### **Conclusion:**

This project is a simple task manager app that allows users to manage tasks by adding, marking as completed, and deleting them. It uses **HTML** for the structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for dynamic interactivity, with localStorage functionality for task persistence. The app provides a basic but effective task management solution with an easy-to-use interface.
